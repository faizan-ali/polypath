# Language Learning Path 🌎

A modern, interactive web application that helps users discover new languages to learn based on their current language knowledge.

This was born out of a conversations with friends about learning new languages which led to some research that landed me on a paper by [Michael Cysouw](https://library.oapen.org/handle/20.500.12657/23714).

Armed with this, I spent a couple hours on a plane ride back from Mexico discussing an implementation with Claude 3.5 Sonnet. This is the result. 

It is an excellent example of the capabilities of modern LLMs to craft algorithms and design UI based on good prompting.
